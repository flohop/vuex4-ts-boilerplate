# vuex4-ts-boilerplate
Create your Vuex4 stores with TypeScript faster, by copy pasting boilerplate code

<ul>
  <li>state.ts     => Declare the types of your state, and give initial values to it</li>
  <li>mutations.ts => Declare the names of your mutations, their function types and implement them</li>
  <li>actions.ts   => Declare the names of your actiosn, their function types and implement them</li>
  <li>getters.ts   => Declare the function types of your getters and implement them</li>
 </ul>
 
 # Warning
 If you change any of the type names, you will have to change every appearance of it. Your IDE should point that out for you.
